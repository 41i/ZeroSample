Zero Sample Codes 

## Who are we 

HPC-Sect is group which promotes HPC(High Performance Computing) through opensource discussions.

## What 

Zero Sample is about begining from zero in HPC domain. 

Here beginers can look at syntactic structure of various HPC platforms like openmp, cuda, opencl etc.   
It is just a nudge, and after understanding these simple codes, one can start with more complex problems
in HPC domain.

Sample programs for following libraries are provided here: 
 ** CUDA
 ** OpenMP
 ** Cilk
 ** OpenCL
 ** MPI 
 ** pthreads

Certain PGAS models, Intel libs and Cuda Libs will be updated later.  

## How
every directory has makefile of its own, so after completing all dependency, run
make 

P.S: Do tinker with codes, and have fun with it.
